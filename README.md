About
------

This module was a re-creation of a real-world interaction between an organisation and
a client. As a team of four, we worked closely with our client to design and implement
a ‘Runway re-declaration Tool’. The project was completed following agile principles.

See user guide on information about the software. See Runnable_Jar/RunwayTool.jar to see the program working.
Jar file depends on folders/files in the containing directory, so you will need to download the whole folder. 
Eclipse build is also included in the folder 'Eclipse_Project' and can be easily imported.
