welcome=Welcome to the Runway Re-Declaration Tool. This page allows you to either create a new Airport or load in an existing one. If you wish to load an airport you should: choose an Airport file (.ser) and click the "Load Airport" button.

about_msg=Runway Configuration Tool 2015 (v. 1.0.0)

This is a tool designed to represent obstructions on a real-life runway. 
Its main purpose is to assist a user on recalculating runway variables based on the information known at the time the runway is redeclared.

All credit in designing and creating this tool goes to the following authors: "

Mark Garnett
Connor Valerio
George Gillams
Ionut Farcas

All parts of this application are solely owned by the University of Southampton

We hope you enjoy using the tool.;;;
